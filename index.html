        <h2>Step 1: Tidy Up</h2>
        <p>Here is a list of some useful tips for winter cleaning before Dec 24:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Clear out old junk.</b> Like that ugly Christmas sweater your aunt got you last Christmas - eewww.</li>
            <li><b>Rearrange the furniture.</b> Top Tip! Hang your stocking <i>over</i> the fireplace instead of in the fireplace - they won't catch on fire and they'll look much nicer!</li>
            <li><b>Set up your own Christmas tree.</b> Decapitating a fir tree and decorating its corpse with lights is a great way to spend the festive season!</li>
            <li><b>Do some vacumming.</b> We recommed Dyson, Shark, or your neighbour's cat if you can handle the scratches.</li>
            <li><b>Hang lights outside your home.</b> If you choose candles for your garden, turn off your fire alarms - they make this really annoying sound.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 2: Milk and Cookies (and carrots)</h2>
        <p>Santa gets a lot of gingerbread this time of year, so other flavours are always appreciated. This year, consider jalape√±o, pickle, or sardine. <abbr title="Just kidding. I don't think it's SO bad. Believe me - there's WAY worse.">But not raisins - that would be disgusting.</abbr></p>
        <p>Milk should be presented warm and semi-skimmed at the least. If you want to be horrible leave the milk in a jug, with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_cup">Pythagorean cup</a>.
        But you'll have to clean up the mess the next morning...</p>
        <p>Don't forget to leave out a carrot for Rudolph. He's the one who does all the work, after all. Animal rights are very overlooked at Christmas.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>And finally: Enjoy the season!</h2>
        <h3>(Seriously this time)</h3>
        <p>Christmas comes once a year so you may as well enjoy it. Spend the time with friends or family or your pet or whoever makes you happy.</p>
        <p>In the end, whether Santa comes or not, that's no excuse not to have fun. </p>
        <p>Have a good one, and I'll see you on the other side in '25.</p>
